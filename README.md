# GitHub Repository

This is a starter SwiftUI project to see how things works.

This project handles HTTP Requests, State Management, Navigation and Clean Architecture. Since this is my very first time coding using Swift and exploring this new world, perhaps somethings could be improved, but, since this is my first one, I've liked the result!
